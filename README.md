## What is Lyrisland?

Lyrisland displays real-time Spotify lyrics at the top of your screen in a Dynamic Island style overlay. Lyrics are precisely synced with playback — lightweight, elegant, and always on your desktop.

## Features

- **Dynamic Island Modes** — Compact, Expanded, and Full modes with smooth animated transitions; Expanded shows track info, Full includes playback controls (prev/play-pause/next)
- **Real-time Sync** — Line-by-line lyrics highlighting, precisely aligned with playback progress
- **Album Artwork** — Displays album art in all three modes — thumbnail in Compact, medium cover in Expanded, large cover in Full
- **Dual-line Lyrics** — Karaoke-style display showing current and next line simultaneously (toggle with ⌘D)
- **Multiple Lyrics Sources** — Fallback chain across 4 providers: LRCLIB → Musixmatch → SodaMusic → Netease, with drag-to-reorder priority and per-source enable/disable in Settings
- **Flexible Positioning** — Snap to menu bar (attached) or free-drag anywhere on screen (detached), with position persisted across launches
- **Background Styles** — Choose from solid color, album gradient, frosted glass, or dynamic gradient backgrounds
- **Customizable Shortcuts** — View, rebind, or disable all keyboard shortcuts in Settings, with conflict detection and one-click reset
- **RTL Support** — Automatic text direction detection for right-to-left languages (e.g. Arabic), with adaptive marquee scroll and alignment
- **Multilingual UI** — Localized in English, 简体中文, 繁體中文, 日本語, 한국어
- **No Login Required** — Reads playback state directly from the local Spotify client via AppleScript, no account authorization needed
- **Lightweight & Resident** — Runs in the menu bar only, no Dock icon, minimal resource usage

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to log in to Spotify?**
No. Lyrisland reads playback info from the local Spotify client without any account authorization.

**Q: Why are there no lyrics for some songs?**
Lyrics come from third-party public databases. Niche tracks or instrumentals may not be available yet.

**Q: What if the lyrics are out of sync?**
Use the offset adjustment from the menu bar icon (`[` / `]` keys, ±0.5 seconds each).

**Q: Does it support Apple Music?**
Currently only Spotify is supported.
